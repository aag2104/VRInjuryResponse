# How Real Sensations Shape VR Injury Response

This project explores how synchronized real-world touch can enhance immersion in VR and trigger emotional or physical reactions to virtual injuries. The study tests whether users react to a fake injury when it’s preceded by repeated, aligned tactile interactions.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To investigate whether consistent real-world textures (like a toothbrush or sandpaper) applied in sync with VR visuals can convince users that a virtual injury is real enough to spark a fear or pain response.

## 🧪 How It Works

- A custom Unity simulation built with the XR Interaction Toolkit runs on a Meta Quest 2 headset.
- Users see a virtual arm from a first-person view while a facilitator applies real textures to their real arm.
- After several rounds of conditioning, the virtual arm is suddenly injured (visually and with sound).
- Participants then complete a post-experience survey measuring emotional, physical, and cognitive responses.

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

- **Unity** (with XR Interaction Toolkit)
- **Meta Quest 2** headset
- **Simple props**: toothbrush, paintbrush, sandpaper
- **Screen mirroring**: iPad or laptop for facilitator view
- **Survey**: Google Forms (template included)
- *(Optional)* Heart rate monitor for biometric feedback

## 📊 Key Findings

- Many users reported flinching or emotional discomfort after the injury.
- Survey responses showed that synchronized tactile feedback increased immersion and believability.
- Even with low-tech tools, strong psychological reactions were triggered.

## 🚧 Limitations

- Manual syncing requires a facilitator and can vary slightly.
- Small sample size—future versions should scale testing.
- Heart rate data was limited due to hardware access.

## 🌱 Future Work

- Automate tactile feedback using vibration motors or pressure sensors.
- Test different types of injuries and longer conditioning periods.
- Apply the framework to training, therapy, or narrative VR experiences.
